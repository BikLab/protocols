# AMPure XP bead clean-up

A. Add 2x the sample volume of the magnetic beads to the sample. 

B. Next, add 2x the sample of the PEG 8000 / 2.5M NaCl to the sample with the magnetic beads.

C. Mix well by pipetting up and down.

> PEG is viscous so you may also vortex the tubes to ensure proper mixing and spin them down. Though it is ideal that no bubbles form, they are inevitable; so just try to reduce their number.

D. Incubate at room temperature for 10-15 mins. 

> You can even put these samples on the thermomixer to incubate at 750 rpm. Just spin them down post incubation.

E. Place the sample on the magnetic rack for 10 mins or until all the beads are bound to one side of the tube and aspirate the solution by pipetting or vacumm suction. 

F. Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack and wash the beads with 200 &#956;L of 80% EtOH.

> Make new 80% EtOH every time you perform the bead clean-up

G. Place the tubes back on the magnetic rack and incubate the samples for 10 mins or until all the beads are bound to one side of the tube and aspirate the solution by pipetting or vacumm suction.

H. Wash the beads one more time for a total of two washes.

I. Remove the samples from the magnetic rack and air dry the beads.

> Be sure the beads are not bone-dry. If they are, you will have a difficult time resuspending them in water.

J. Resuspend the beads in 22 &#956;L of PCR grade water and place back on the magnetic rack for 10 mins or until all the beads are bound to one side of the tube.

K. Elute 20 &#956;L of each sample into new tubes.
