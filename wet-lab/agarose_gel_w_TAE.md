# Prepare 1% agarose gel with 1X Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer

### 1	Introduction

Agarose gels are run using two types of electrophoresis buffers (TAE and TBE). This protocol uses 1x TAE buffer to prepare a 1% agarose gel. Depending on the expected band sizes, you may increase or decrease the agarose concentration. For small bands, use a higher concentration and vice versa.  

##### To prepare a 2% gel double to mass of agrose; keep the final volume the same 

#### 1.1 Preparing 1% agarose gel - Small gel

  * Weigh **0.5 g of agarose** and add it to **50 mL 1x TAE buffer** in a **150 mL flask**.
  * Microwave the solution to melt the agarose. Start by running the microwave for 30 seconds at a time until the agarose completely dissolves in the buffer.
  * When the liquid is warm to touch add **5 &#956;l of SYBR Safe DNA stain** and mix by swirling slowly.
  * Pour the gel in the caster slowly to avoid bubbles.
  * Put in one or two combs depending on the number of samples.  

#### 1.2 Preparing 1% agarose gel - Big gel box
  * Weigh **1.5 g of agarose** and add it to **150 mL 1x TAE buffer** in a **500 mL flask**.
  * Microwave the solution to melt the agarose. Start by running the microwave for 45 seconds at a time until the agarose completely dissolves in the buffer.
  * When the liquid is warm to touch add **15 &#956;l of SYBR Safe DNA stain** and mix by swirling slowly.
  * Pour the gel in the caster slowly to avoid bubbles.
  * Put in one or two combs depending on the number of samples.
